## What is the difference between this and the previous my_sokoban?
<u>__Currently, the only differences are:__</u>

 * Amount of moves are shown at the top left of your screen
 * You can play with WASD
 * Accessible debug menu by pressing `P` (to check what key you are pressing, how many boxes are marked as lost, how many targets are left, hogwarts mode and what "block" you are currently on)
 * Quit Game forcefully without using CTRL + C by pressing `Q` - Returns 2
 * Hogwarts mode (toggleable with H key):
   * Player can go through walls (but not out of boundaries)
   * Boxes can not be pushed through walls
